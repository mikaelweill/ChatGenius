# Authentication Optimization

## Server-Side Implementation (âœ… COMPLETED)
- âœ… Created central auth module in `lib/auth.ts`
- âœ… Implemented server-side caching with 5-minute duration
- âœ… Added robust error handling with specific error types
- âœ… Cache invalidation on auth errors
- âœ… Updated all server components to use centralized auth:
  - âœ… Main layout
  - âœ… Channel pages
  - âœ… DM pages

## API Routes (âœ… COMPLETED)
- âœ… Updated auth endpoints:
  - âœ… Signin route
  - âœ… Logout route with cache clearing
- âœ… Updated data endpoints:
  - âœ… Search route
  - âœ… Messages route
  - âœ… Upload route
- âœ… Consistent error handling across all routes
- âœ… Proper cache utilization

## WebSocket Auth (âœ… ALREADY OPTIMIZED)
- âœ… Single auth check on connection
- âœ… Efficient userId caching in socket.data
- âœ… No repeated auth calls
- âœ… Proper security checks for user actions

## Frontend Implementation (ðŸ‘ˆ NEXT UP)
- Centralize frontend auth logic
- Clean up client-side components:
  - SessionProvider
  - LogoutButton
  - SignIn page
  - Socket hooks
- Remove redundant token management
- Leverage Supabase's built-in session handling

## Testing Plan
1. Server Component Auth:
   - Sign out and verify redirect to signin page
   - Visit authenticated routes directly (e.g., /channels/general) while logged out
   - Verify single auth check in Network tab for multiple page navigations within 5 minutes
   - Wait 5 minutes and verify new auth check occurs

2. API Route Auth:
   - Use Network tab to monitor auth calls during:
     - Message searches
     - File uploads
     - Message sending
   - Verify auth errors are handled gracefully
   - Test rate limiting by making rapid requests

3. WebSocket Testing:
   - Monitor socket connection in Network tab
   - Verify single auth check on connection
   - Test reconnection behavior on network interruption
   - Verify status updates work after reconnection

4. Cache Validation:
   - Sign out from one tab and verify other tabs redirect
   - Test auth error scenarios to verify cache clearing
   - Monitor Redis/server logs for cache hits/misses

5. Error Scenarios:
   - Modify auth token to be invalid
   - Test expired sessions
   - Test malformed requests
   - Verify error messages are helpful but not revealing

## Key Learnings & Decisions
1. Server-side caching with 5-minute duration provides good balance of security and performance
2. Centralized error handling improves consistency and debugging
3. WebSocket auth was already well-optimized with single auth check
4. Frontend can leverage Supabase's built-in session management
5. Removed redundant auth checks in API routes
6. Cache invalidation on auth errors prevents serving stale data

## Next Steps
1. Review and plan frontend auth optimization
2. Consider consolidating WebSocket status management with auth state
3. Add monitoring for auth performance metrics
4. Execute testing plan to verify optimizations
