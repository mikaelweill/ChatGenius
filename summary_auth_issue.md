# Authentication Issues Summary

## Core Issues Identified
1. Safari-specific authentication problems
   - Incorrect username display
   - Login difficulties
   - Session state management issues

2. Socket Connection Challenges
   - User ID management complications
   - Potential user identity confusion during socket connections
   - Session handling inconsistencies

## Proposed Solutions
1. Token-based Authentication
   - Implement token-based auth for socket connections
   - Ensure proper validation of user identity
   - Maintain consistent session state

2. Socket Connection Management
   - Implement proper cleanup of socket connections
   - Better handling of user disconnection events
   - Improved session tracking

## Next Steps
1. Implement token validation on socket connection
2. Add proper error handling for authentication failures
3. Ensure proper cleanup of socket connections on user logout
4. Add logging for debugging authentication flow
5. Test specifically for Safari-related edge cases

## Technical Considerations
- Need to maintain consistent user identity across different browser sessions
- Important to handle browser-specific behaviors (especially Safari)
- Consider implementing reconnection logic with proper authentication
- Ensure proper cleanup of resources on disconnection
