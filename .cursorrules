When asked a question always follow this template:
1. give me your best guess
2. keep it concise
3. provide the minimal code changes
4. take it step by steps (baby steps)

NEVER SUGGEST A MIDDLEWARE -- 
Also do not delete code when you do not need to. Try to make the edits proposed
as concise and close to the goal as possible.
